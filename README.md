# Workout Rest Timer
A timer app that helps keep consistent rest periods between weight lifting sets. By default it plays a _get ready_ sound at 7 seconds and a _start_ sound when the timer hits 0. 

The repo includes an iOS wrapper app written in Swift to run it natively on an Apple device and let the sounds play even if the timer is running in the background (e.g. while adjusting a music playlist).
