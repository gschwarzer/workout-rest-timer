# Workout Rest Timer
A timer app that helps to keep consistent rest periods between weight lifting sets. Plays a get ready sound at 7 seconds and a start sound at 0. Includes an iOS wrapper app to run it natively on a device and let the sounds play even if the timer is running in the background (for example while managing a playlist).
